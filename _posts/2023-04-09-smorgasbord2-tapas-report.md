The Gallantries has **again** just run the largest-ever Galaxy training event: ["the GTN Smörgåsbord 2: Tapas Edition"](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord2/tapas.html), co-organized with the [CINECA project](https://cineca-project.eu) and the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org).

## Exponential Growth

We had an unbelievable 3300 registrations from 111 different countries around the world. ~1.5k of these joined Slack (chat platform) which we used to communicate during the event, surpassing our best estimates.

With instructors and organisers from the [CINECA project](https://cineca-project.eu), the [Gallantries](https://gallantries.github.io), and the worldwide Galaxy training community, we re-used our global workshop event plan. For this event we continued with a **fully asynchronous** event. This meant having all training materials online, including pre-recorded videos, slides, hands-on manuals, and of course the Galaxy servers to run the tutorials on.

Given the success of the previous year's event, it was an easy choice!

This format meant participants could follow along **at their own pace**, and on their own time schedule, allowing it to be combined with other activities such as work and child-care responsibilities. The program also reflected this flexibility, with most days consisting of stand-alone modules, that could be skipped if participants were not so interested in that particular topic, and followed on any day of the training week if needed. With **all the materials being publicly available online**, participants also knew they would be able to continue with the course after the event if needed, relieving some time pressure.

Due to the existing focus on supporting self-study in all our [GTN training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org), and the focus of the Gallantries project on creating broadcast-friendly materials, this switch to this virtual asynchronous format was relatively painless.

## Participants

We had registrations from around the world

Following a gender balance that largely reflects that of the human population which was excellent to see:

  alt="Gender balance pie chart, 50.2% women; 47,6% men; 1,7% rather not say; 0,4% NB">

</figure>

The first iteration featured <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> documents per channel, something we've used heavily in the past. This year they were moved into the Galaxy Training Network to make it easier to link to specific answer. We have [now collected around 300 Galaxy FAQs.](https://training.galaxyproject.org/faqs/)

## Innovation: Slackbot

This year's biggest innovation was the addition of the GTN Slack bot. This is a python bot we developed which allows users to record completion of individual tutorials as they go, rather than asking them to keep track of their histories and submit them all at once at the end. Users struggled with that modality.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/smorg2-slackbot.png"
  alt="A user is receiving a message from the Slack bot congratulating them in the galaxy interface tutorial channel.">
  <figcaption>Slack bot dramatically increased engagement in an otherwise "quiet" training event, as most questions were answered by materials or FAQs from previous years. In a finely honed training event, we have to find additional ways to engage students like congratulating them on their successes.</figcaption>
</figure>

Slack bot also gave us an opportunity to reach out to users as they completed tutorials and see if they liked the content or suggest that they write some comments in the channel to the organisers as feedback. Additionally we received essentially "live" feedback from students of how many were completing which tutorial and when, invaluable data for us as organisers.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/smorg2-byday.png"
  alt="A bar chart showing how many tutorials were completed by day, additionally broken down by topic. We see ~225 tutorial completions for the 5 main days of the event, and then ~90 per day for the subsequent two weeks.">
  <figcaption>An example of the live reporting we as administrators can now see. In previous years we did not know the sheer number of participants that continued working through tutorials for the next three weeks. We only saw the certificate requests when they happened.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Course Website

All the content for the course was collected on the [course webpage](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord2/tapas.html), which served as the main entry point for participants. Here all the information needed to follow the course was presented. Participants could view the program, find links to the videos, slides, training manuals, Slack channels, FAQ documents and all other relevant information for each of the sessions.

This webpage was completely public, and has remained online ever since the event. This means that participants can continue working through the materials after the course, and anybody can now use the materials for self-study, even if they did not participate in the original event.

## Videos

The main innovation with this event was the asynchronous nature. We pre-recorded all training sessions and made them [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoMMZPbz1L9AZzvIvrvqYA/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=4) for our students. This enabled us to provide subtitles for the videos, which was extremely valuable for the accessibility of the event, given the world-wide nature and number of non-native English speakers that would participate in this event, both as instructors and students.

  alt="Screenshot of the youtube playlists. Why do sighted users like these screenshots? They're not informative.">
  <figcaption>As a community we recorded <b>100 hours of video</b>, corrected the captions for it, and posted it online, free to the world, forever.</figcaption>
</figure>

For our **100 hours of video**, by watch time we again saw approximately half of users used subtitles. This is now a mandatory requirement for course materials in Smörgåsbord.


## Slack

We saw a significant improvement in weekly active members on slack over the previous event, but of course these are all proxy statistics, and this one specifically unfortunately excludes Iranian members who cannot access Slack.

![chart of slack weekly active members with lines for smorgasbord 1 and 2. 2 has approximately twice the number of weekly active members as its peak](/assets/images/smorg2-slack.png)

In order to encourage engagement in Slack, we posted daily icebreakers during the event:

1. Introduce yourself, tell us where you're joining from, and one thing about your surroundings (e.g. it's snowing outside, there's a squirrel on my porch, my cat is on my keyboard)
2. Share with us how your 5-year-old self would have finished this sentence: 'When I grow up, I want to be ...' (and what you are actually doing now that you're grown up)
3. Share with us your favorite dish (food or drink) bonus points for recipes! ;)
4. Please let us know what you favorite thing about the course is so far.
5. Share one of your favorite books, TV shows, movies or games that you would recommend to others.

These were absolutely fantastic for student engagement during the event. It let them share something and others comment on it, fostering discussion in what could otherwise a very isolating experience working along in your home or office. Overall this created a very positive environment with lots of interaction among participants and between participants and instructors.

## Feedback

The feedback from students was very positive. Most students found the training extremely useful to them.

Rating | Students
--- | ---
5 - Incredibly Useful | 173
4 | 78
3 | 9
2 | 1
1 - Not useful at all | 1

We interrogated whether students used primarily the tutorials, a mixture, or primarily the videos:

Resource | Count
--- | ---
1 - Primarily Tutorial Text| 43
2 | 34
3 - Equal Mixture | 74
4 | 39
5 - Primarily Videos | 72

And it was a surprisingly even balance! Students found the balance of materials and the freedom to choose their preferred format a very convenient feature.

We asked students about the best and worst aspects of the event. They identified a number of things they really liked
- Flexibility
- Interactions on Slack
- Choosing their own Pace

Likewise we asked about the worst aspects of the event for them:

- Timezone difficulties (we have fewer instructors for specific topics in some regions)
- "1 week is not enough"
- Some outdated videos where tutorials had been updated since the video

## Accessibility

We continued to received good responses regarding the accessibility of the event. Students with disabilities really appreciate instructors taking the small amount of time to caption their videos.

This enabled not only <abbr title="The 'uppercase D' Deaf is used to describe people who identify as culturally Deaf, while the lowercase d deaf simply refers to the physical condition of having hearing loss">d/Deaf</abbr>/<abbr title="Hard-of-hearing is a widely-accepted term to describe mild to moderate hearing loss">HoH</abbr> participants to attend, but also those who might have struggled with the accents of our instructors, or the rate at which they spoke. Another 8 registrants specifically requested recordings (something they might have missed in the course advertising) but yet another fantastic benefit of asynchronous events like ours is that all materials remain online and participants can follow them at their own pace, reviewing them as needed.

## Infrastructure

This course was made possibly through the support of the 3 largest Galaxy servers, [Galaxy Main](https://usegalaxy.org) in the US, [Galaxy Europe](https://usegalaxy.eu), and [Galaxy Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au). Additionally we were supported by [Galaxy Belgium](https://usegalaxy.be) and [Galaxy France](https://usegalaxy.fr) The teams behind each of those Galaxy servers invested a lot of time and effort to ensure all necessary tools were available and running smoothly, and that sufficient resources were available to handle such a large number of participants at the same time. By using multiple Galaxy servers in geographically distinct locations, the computational load was spread out over multiple sites, and participants could use the server nearest them for the best experience. This also meant we had fallback options in case one of the servers experienced any downtime (which they did not).

# Thank You

We'd like to say thank you to all of our speaker, instructors, sysadmins and sponsors!

## Instructors

A huge thank you to the instructors who produced videos, as well as the huge number of folks who helped edit and correct captions and answered questions online during the week. We could not have done this without you!
